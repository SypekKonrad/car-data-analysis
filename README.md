# Car Refueling Data Analysis

The project is hosted at: [Car Refueling Data Dashboard](https://konradsypek.xyz/car-data).

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world data collected from my car refueling habits to uncover insights into fuel consumption, costs, and driving behavior. The data is processed and analyzed using Python, with the help of libraries like Pandas and NumPy, to extract meaningful trends and patterns that can inform decisions about fuel efficiency and driving habits.

## Car Specifications

The analysis is based on data from a Toyota Avensis T22, which has the following technical specifications:
- **Engine Type**: 2.0L, inline 4, turbocharged
- **Power**: 110 horsepower
- **Curb Weight**: 1410 kg
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel

## How It Works
1. **Data Fetch Notebook**: Refueling logs are collected in CSV files or spreadsheets, capturing details like date, cost, kilometers traveled, and liters of fuel filled.
2. **Fuel Economy Notebook**: Analyzes fuel consumption trends for the Toyota Avensis T22, including average fuel efficiency (L/100km) and visualizations of consumption over time and its relationship with distance traveled.
3. **Cost Analysis Notebook**: Calculates fuel expenditure, price per kilometer, and fuel efficiency, providing insights into total and average costs. Visualizes trends in fuel prices and travel cost efficiency over time.
4. **Seasonal Analysis Notebook:**: Analyzes fuel consumption and efficiency across different seasons, calculating average fuel consumption (L/100km) and fuel efficiency (km/L) for Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Visualizes seasonal trends using bar charts for comparison.
